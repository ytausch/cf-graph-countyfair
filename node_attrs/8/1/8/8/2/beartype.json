   "description": "Beartype is an open-source pure-Python runtime type checker emphasizing\nefficiency, portability, and thrilling puns. Unlike comparable static type\ncheckers operating at the coarse-grained application level (e.g., Pyre,\nmypy, pyright, pytype), beartype operates exclusively at the fine-grained\ncallable level of pure-Python functions and methods via the standard\ndecorator design pattern. This renders beartype natively compatible with\nall interpreters and compilers targeting the Python language \u2013 including\nCPython, PyPy, and Numba. Unlike comparable runtime type checkers (e.g.,\npytypes, typeguard), beartype wraps each decorated callable with a\ndynamically generated wrapper efficiently type-checking that specific\ncallable. Since \"performance by default\" is our first-class concern, all\nwrappers are guaranteed to exhibit O(1) time complexity with negligible\nconstant factors and be either more efficient (in the common case) or\nexactly as efficient minus the cost of an additional stack frame (in the\nworst case) as equivalent type-checking implemented by hand. Beartype thus\nbrings Rust- and C++-inspired zero-cost abstractions into the deliciously\nlawless world of pure Python.\n",

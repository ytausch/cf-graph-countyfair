   "description": "This is a plugin for OpenMM that allows neural networks to be\nused for defining forces. It is implemented with PyTorch.\nTo use it, you create a PyTorch model that takes particle\npositions as input and produces energy as output. This plugin\nuses the model to apply forces to particles during a simulation.\n",

This plugin\nuses the model to apply forces to particles during a simulation.\n",

It is implemented with PyTorch.\n    To use it, you create a PyTorch model that takes particle\n    positions as input and produces energy as output. This plugin\n    uses the model to apply forces to particles during a simulation.\n  doc_url: https://github.com/openmm/openmm-torch\n  dev_url: https://github.com/openmm/openmm-torch\n\nextra:\n  recipe-maintainers:\n    - raimis\n    - jaimergp\n    - peastman\n    - mikemhenry\n",

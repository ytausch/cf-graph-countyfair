Circle Manhattan Plot is the first open R package that can lay out. Genome-wide association study P-value results in both traditional rectangular patterns, QQ-plot and novel circular ones. United in only one bull's eye style plot, association results from multiple traits can be compared interactively, thereby to reveal both similarities and differences between signals.

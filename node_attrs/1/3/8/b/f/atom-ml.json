   "description": "During the exploration phase of a machine learning project, a data\nscientist tries to find the optimal pipeline for his specific use case.\nThis usually involves applying standard data cleaning steps, creating\nor selecting useful features, trying out different models, etc. Testing\nmultiple pipelines requires many lines of code, and writing it all in\nthe same notebook often makes it long and cluttered. On the other hand,\nusing multiple notebooks makes it harder to compare the results and to\nkeep an overview. On top of that, refactoring the code for every test\ncan be time-consuming. How many times have you conducted the same action\nto pre-process a raw dataset? How many times have you copy-and-pasted\ncode from an old repository to re-use it in a new use case?\nATOM is here to help solve these common issues. The package acts as\na wrapper of the whole machine learning pipeline, helping the data\nscientist to rapidly find a good model for his problem. Avoid\nendless imports and documentation lookups. Avoid rewriting the same\ncode over and over again. With just a few lines of code, it's now\npossible to perform basic data cleaning steps, select relevant\nfeatures and compare the performance of multiple models on a given\ndataset, providing quick insights on which pipeline performs best\nfor the task at hand.\n",

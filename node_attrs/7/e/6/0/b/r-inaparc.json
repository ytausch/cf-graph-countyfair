They require some initialization procedures for starting to partition the data sets. Initialization of cluster prototypes is one of such kind of procedures for most of the partitioning algorithms. Cluster prototypes are the data elements, i.e. centroids or medoids, representing the clusters in a data set. In order to initialize cluster prototypes, the package 'inaparc' contains a set of the functions that are the implementations of several linear time-complexity and loglinear time-complexity methods in addition to some novel techniques. Initialization of fuzzy membership degrees matrices is another important task for starting the probabilistic and possibilistic partitioning algorithms.

Many applications may be able to use the Osi to insulate themselves\n    from a specific LP solver. That is, programs written to the OSI standard may\n    be linked to any solver with an OSI interface and should produce correct\n    results. The OSI has been significantly extended compared to its first\n    incarnation. Currently, the OSI supports linear programming solvers and has\n    rudimentary support for integer programming. Among others the following\n    operations are supported:\n\n      - creating the LP formulation;\n      - directly modifying the formulation by adding rows/columns;\n      - modifying the formulation by adding cutting planes provided by CGL;\n      - solving the formulation (and resolving after modifications);\n      - extracting solution information;\n      - invoking the underlying solver's branch-and-bound component.\n\nextra:\n  recipe-maintainers:\n    - wolfv\n    - tkralphs\n    - jschueller\n",
